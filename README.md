# Front-End Challenge 

This application is the result of a Frontend challenge, where we were asked to create a mockup design of a page showcasing items available for purchase from the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.

This application uses Vue.js and 100% pure CSS without any framework. Also, it adjusts to different screen sizes ensuring that all the content is accessible on mobile, tablet and desktop views.

You can find a version of this application at [link].
